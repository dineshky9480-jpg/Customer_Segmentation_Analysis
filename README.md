📊Client Project Completed | Customer Segmentation & Sales Analytics | A+ Grade

I’m proud to share that I successfully completed a client-based Customer Segmentation & Sales Analytics project, securing an A+ grade for performance, accuracy, and business insights delivery.

This project focused on analyzing customer purchasing behavior and sales trends to help the client improve decision-making. Using SQL and Power BI, raw transactional data was transformed into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards.

📌 Key KPIs Tracked

• Total Sales 
• Total Transactions
• Average Order Value
• Total Customers

🛠️ Tools Used

• MySQL (Data Extraction & Analysis)
• Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization)
• SQL (Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations)
• MS Excel (Data Validation)

📊 Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear view of customer segments, revenue patterns, top-performing regions, and product performance. Interactive filters allow stakeholders to analyze data by age group, season, and category for deeper insights.

📌 This project strengthened my end-to-end analytics skills and client-focused problem-solving approach.
